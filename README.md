# Herrscher

**A self-hosted bridge between a chat platform and an AI agent.** You run one
daemon. It brings a bot online 24/7, exposes slash commands to spin up isolated
**sessions**, and for each session it turns your messages into prompts, asks a
model, and posts the answer back — streaming tool activity and cost as it goes.
Every session can run in its own git worktree, so an agent works on real code in
isolation.

This is the **single binary**: the agnostic domain (`core`), the composition root
and daemon, and the plugin-management CLI all live here in one module. The
swappable edges — the channel gateway, the model backend, memory and the
orchestrator — stay in their own repos and are compiled in. The host itself is
**gateway-agnostic**: it imports zero `dctl` (the concrete Discord client) and
drives chat platforms only through the contracts `Gateway` port — an invariant
guarded by purity tests (`TestHostPurity`, `TestCorePurity`).

> Built with hexagonal architecture: a narrow contract package in the middle,
> interchangeable edges (the channel, the model), an agnostic domain, and a host
> that bolts them together. Swapping Discord for Slack, or Claude for another
> model, is a one-file wiring change — never a domain rewrite.

## The mental model

Herrscher has exactly **one job**: route. Someone says something on a channel →
the platform figures out which agent session that conversation belongs to →
forwards it to a model → posts the answer back. The domain in the middle
(`core`) never knows *who* is speaking or *which* model answers. It only knows
the **ports** declared in `contracts`.

Two facts hold the whole design together:

1. **`contracts` is the authority.** It dictates the shape every plugin must
   implement, and contains zero platform-specific mechanics. No "Discord", no
   "Claude" — just neutral ports and types.
2. **All dependency arrows point toward `contracts`.** The core depends on no
   edge; the edges depend on no core. Only the host (the binary's `main`) ever
   sees both concrete types at once, in a single wiring file.

```

**The golden rule** is the arrows above: everything points *in* toward
`contracts`. That is what makes the edges swappable and the domain stable.
Neither the host nor `core` ever imports a concrete adapter: there is no `dctl`
anywhere in this module — it lives only in the Discord gateway plugin. The host
talks to every chat platform through the contracts `Gateway` port, and that
invariant is enforced by `TestHostPurity` (root) and `TestCorePurity` (`core/`),
which fail the build if a concrete client ever leaks in.

---

## The plugin model — four categories

Plugins are compiled **into** the single binary (the [xcaddy] pattern): you add a
blank import and rebuild — no dynamic loading. Each plugin self-registers into the
global `contracts.Default` registry from its `init()`, before any token or runtime
config exists. The host then asks the registry for what it needs at startup and
instantiates it with live config. They run **in-process by default**; a category
can opt into running as a **separate process** over the NATS/gRPC transport (see
[Roadmap](#roadmap)) with no plugin code change.

[xcaddy]: https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy

`contracts` declares **four** plugin categories:

| Category | Edge | Port(s) | Status | Official plugin |
|----------|------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| 🔌 **Gateway** | channel (inbound) | `Gateway`, `ChannelSource`, `ChannelReader`, `ChannelAdmin`, `CommandRegistrar`, `Prober`, `MenuRouter`, `Responder`, `EventSink` (smart gateways), `Foreground` (a gateway that owns the main thread, e.g. a TUI) | ✅ live | [herrscher-discord-gateway], in-tree `terminal` |
| 🧠 **Backend** | model (outbound) | `Backend` (+ `ChoiceAware`, `ChoiceInjector`) | ✅ live | [herrscher-claude-backend], [herrscher-codex-backend], [herrscher-cursor-backend] |
| 🗄️ **Memory** | recall / persistence | `Memory` | ✅ live | [herrscher-obsidian-memory] |
| 🪢 **Orchestrator** | conversation policy | `Orchestrator` | ✅ live | [herrscher-orchestrator] |

[herrscher-discord-gateway]: https://github.com/Herrscherd/herrscher-discord-gateway
[herrscher-claude-backend]: https://github.com/Herrscherd/herrscher-claude-backend
[herrscher-codex-backend]: https://github.com/Herrscherd/herrscher-codex-backend
[herrscher-cursor-backend]: https://github.com/Herrscherd/herrscher-cursor-backend
[herrscher-obsidian-memory]: https://github.com/Herrscherd/herrscher-obsidian-memory
[herrscher-orchestrator]: https://github.com/Herrscherd/herrscher-orchestrator

All four categories have an official plugin. **Orchestrator** is a
conversation-policy port; the default stack ships the published
`herrscher-orchestrator` module (the `basic` kind). Every plugin plugs in the
same way — a blank import and a rebuild, no domain change.

Gateways come in two flavours. A plain gateway exposes only the read/post ports;
for it the host posts **only the final reply** (chunked), with no platform-
specific dressing. A **smart gateway** also implements `EventSink`, receives the
raw turn-event stream, and renders it itself (live progress, emojis, summary).
Both shipped gateways are smart: the in-tree **`terminal`** gateway
(`plugins/terminal`) is a Bubbletea TUI that `serve` brings up in the foreground
as a first-class peer of Discord, and the **Discord** gateway renders its own
progress message, ⏳ acknowledgement, and summary via DCTL. Rich, platform-
specific presentation lives in the gateway — never in the host: the host only
emits **abstract semantic events** (turn received, reply, mid-turn reset, and an
`abandoned` signal when a turn ends without a reply), and each gateway decides
how to display them. The host never picks an emoji or reaction itself.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["author a plugin<br/>(implements a contracts port)"]
    B["add blank import<br/>in plugins.go<br/>between the markers"]
    C["go build -o herrscher ."]
    D["plugin self-registers<br/>via init() → contracts.Default"]
    E["host discovers it<br/>at startup"]
    A --> B --> C --> D --> E
```

Optional ports may be **nil**: the host wraps the gateway in a degrading decorator
(`contracts.Degrade`) so a plugin that can't, say, render select-menus simply
falls back to plain text instead of crashing.

---

## The members

This repo holds the **binary** and everything agnostic that ships inside it. One
external module stays separate by design: `contracts`, so third-party plugins can
import the ports without pulling in the host.

| Location | Repo | Role |
|----------|------|------|
| `core/` (this repo) | — | The agnostic domain: sessions, channels, worktrees, supervision. |
| `main.go`, `serve.go`, … (this repo) | — | The composition root and daemon — gateway-agnostic, drives platforms only through the `Gateway` port. |
| `manage/` (this repo) | — | The plugin-composition CLI (`init` / `plugin` / `update` / `install`). |
| external module | [herrscher-contracts] | The ports: interfaces + neutral types. Zero deps, zero logic. |

[herrscher-contracts]: https://github.com/Herrscherd/herrscher-contracts

The **edges** are interchangeable plugins, each its own repo, **not** part of the
binary's module — they are the official Gateway, Backend, Memory and Orchestrator
listed in the table above. [`dctl`] is not a family member either: it is the
pure, dependency-free Discord REST client (v10) the **gateway plugin** consumes —
no gateway socket, no CLI, just on-demand HTTP. The host never imports it (it
shows up only as an *indirect* dependency, pulled in transitively by the gateway
plugin).

[`dctl`]: https://github.com/Herrscherd/dctl

---

## How a message flows

The **daemon (hub)** owns all gateway I/O. Each session's driver polls every
bound gateway for input, serializes those inputs through a per-session FIFO, and
hands one input frame per turn to a **pure-runner bridge** over a persistent
control socket. The bridge talks only to the backend; it streams the turn's
events back over the same socket, and the hub fans them out to every bound
gateway. One turn is active at a time: the next queued input is sent only after
the current turn ends — either its terminal `reply{done}`, or an abandonment
(bridge disconnect or shutdown), which fans out an abstract `abandoned` signal so
smart gateways can finalize their live acknowledgement.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor U as Human
    participant CH as Channel (Discord / terminal)
    participant GW as Gateway plugin
    participant HUB as Hub session driver (core/host)
    participant BR as Bridge (pure runner)
    participant BE as Backend plugin
    participant M as Model (Claude)

    U->>CH: types a message
    HUB->>GW: Read(channel, after=lastID)
    GW-->>HUB: [Message{content, author, attachments}]
    Note over HUB: enqueue on the session FIFO<br/>(one active turn at a time)
    HUB->>BR: input frame (over control socket)
    BR->>BE: Respond(Prompt, onEvent)
    BE->>M: stream prompt
    loop streaming
        M-->>BE: tool calls · text · cost
        BE-->>BR: onEvent(BackendEvent)
        BR-->>HUB: chunk / status events
        HUB->>GW: fan out to every bound gateway<br/>(smart gateway renders itself; plain gateway gets the final reply only)
    end
    M-->>BE: final answer (+ total cost)
    BE-->>BR: output string
    BR-->>HUB: reply{Done:true, Cost}
    HUB->>GW: deliver reply event<br/>(smart: rendered in-gateway; plain: posted, split to 2000)
    GW->>CH: shows the reply
    Note over HUB: turn ends → next FIFO input may start
```

A **smart gateway** (both Discord and the terminal) implements `EventSink` and
renders the live event stream itself — progress, emojis, and a cost summary. For
a plain gateway the host only posts the final reply, chunked; it adds no
platform-specific presentation, keeping the host gateway-agnostic.

If the model hits a permission prompt mid-turn, the backend exposes a
`PendingChoice`; when the `MenuRouter` capability is present, the gateway posts a
**select menu** keyed to the session, the hub routes the click to the session's
FIFO (`Pick`), and the bridge injects the choice into the live session
(`InjectChoice`) out-of-band. Otherwise it degrades to a plain-text prompt.

---

## The two run modes

The same binary runs in two shapes. **`serve`** is the always-on daemon (the
multi-gateway **hub**, `host.RunHub`) you install as a service; it owns all
gateway I/O and supervises one pure-runner **`bridge`** child process per
session. When `serve` runs on an interactive TTY, it also runs the one bound
gateway that implements the `Foreground` capability on the main thread — the
in-tree **terminal gateway** by default, an in-process Bubbletea TUI that is a
first-class gateway peer of Discord (quitting it stops the daemon). `serve` never
imports a concrete frontend: any plugin can implement `Foreground` and replace
the default. A background service (no TTY) runs headless, hub-driven only.

> **Command surface (current):** operator commands run through a neutral
> `contracts.Cmd` registry, reachable two ways. The operator **CLI** (`herrscher
> session create|close|list|who`, `herrscher service restart|update`, `herrscher
> set home|source`) dispatches them directly. The **Discord gateway** binds the
> same commands as slash commands: it translates each interaction into a neutral
> argv and dispatches it through the `contracts.SessionControl` seam, so the core
> never learns the Discord command surface. All slash handling (including the
> `/allow` permission lists) lives in the gateway plugin; the daemon only ever
> sees neutral argv.

### `serve` — the always-on daemon

    SUP --> CHILD["spawn child:<br/>herrscher bridge -c CHANNEL --cmd ...<br/>(in the session worktree)"]
    CHILD -->|exits| RESTART["restart w/ backoff+jitter"] --> CHILD
```

### `bridge` — the pure-runner backend loop

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    P(["herrscher bridge -c CHANNEL --hub-socket …"]) --> DIAL["Dial the hub control socket"]
    DIAL --> WAIT{"read next frame from the hub"}
    WAIT -->|input| RESP["backend.Respond(prompt, onEvent)"]
    WAIT -->|pick| INJ["backend.InjectChoice(value)"]
    RESP --> EV["onEvent → emit chunk / status events over the socket"]
    EV --> DONE["emit reply{Done:true}"]
    INJ --> DONE
    DONE --> WAIT
    WAIT -->|socket closed| EXIT["exit → supervisor restarts + reconnects"]
```

The bridge does **no** gateway I/O: it never reads a channel, posts, or reacts.

### Terminal TUI — multi-session tabbed interface

When `serve` runs on an interactive TTY, the in-tree terminal gateway (a
Bubbletea TUI) takes over the foreground and brings multiple sessions online as
a tabbed interface; any configured Discord gateway keeps running headless in the
background. Each session bound to the terminal appears as a tab; use `Tab` and
`Shift+Tab` to switch between them. When a background tab receives output from
the model, it displays a bullet marker (`•`) to indicate unread activity; switching
to that tab clears the marker. 

**Session management.** Create, list, and close sessions directly from the TUI
using slash commands — no Discord required. Type `/session create --name foo` to
spin up a new session; it appears immediately as a new tab. Use `/session list`
to see active sessions, and `/session close --name foo` to shut one down and remove
its tab. Sessions are bound to the terminal and isolated by name; typing routes your
input to the active session and streams replies into its pane.

It is a stateless backend runner driven entirely by the hub's input frames. The
hub owns the FIFO and connection lifecycle, so if the bridge crashes the
supervisor restarts it and it re-dials the same socket, resuming with the next
queued input. Authorization and message-id tracking live in the hub, not here.

**Keybindings.**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Switch to next/previous session tab |
| `Enter` | Send the typed line to the active session (lines starting with `/` are run as commands) |
| `Ctrl+W` then `y` | Close the active session (any other key cancels) |
| `?` (empty input) | Toggle keybinding help overlay |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn` | Scroll the active tab's transcript |
| `Ctrl+C` / `Esc` | Quit the TUI (shuts down the daemon) |

Tab markers: `•` = unread background activity, `⟳` = streaming. Footer shows active session state (working/idle/disconnected) and last turn cost.

---

## Session lifecycle

A **session** is the unit of work: a channel + an agent + (optionally) an isolated
git worktree, supervised by a long-lived bridge.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Created: /session create name:x
    Created --> Worktree: branch session/x + isolated tree<br/>(unless shared:true)
    Worktree --> Channel: CreateUnder(home) or ForumPost(home)
    Channel --> Running: supervisor spawns the bridge child
    Running --> Running: restart w/ backoff+jitter if the bridge exits
    Running --> Closed: /session close name:x
    Closed --> [*]: stop bridge · remove worktree · archive channel
```

- `project:` picks an existing repo from your workspace; `clone:` forges one
  first (gh/glab). `shared:true` skips the worktree and runs in the main checkout.
- `/session close` refuses to delete a worktree with uncommitted work unless you
  pass `force:true`.
- `/session allow` and `/allow` gate who may *drive* a session; everyone else is
  observed (journaled for `/session who`) but never executes.
- `agent:` (CLI `--agent NAME`) provisions the session from a **durable companion
  agent**: it materializes that agent's persona and config into the session
  worktree before the channel is created. This requires an isolated git worktree —
  it is rejected with `shared:true` or a non-git project. The session records
  which agent it was provisioned from (see [Durable agents](#durable-agents)).

---

## Inter-session coordination

A session's agent can spin up, hand off to, and collect other sessions without
any human in the loop. It signals an intent by ending its reply with a single
**trailer** — one line, the reply's very last, prefixed with `⟢`. The hub parses
that trailer after the turn and a deterministic coordinator executes it; each
trailer maps one-to-one onto a method of the `Coordinator` port (in
[herrscher-contracts]).

| Trailer | Shape | Effect |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `⟢ done:` | `<summary>` | Report result back to the parent that delegated this session |
| `⟢ delegate:` | `<agent> — <task>` | Spawn a worker on `agent`; the lead stays alive, the worker reports back with `⟢ done` |
| `⟢ fanout:` | `<agent> — <task1> ;; <task2> …` | Spawn a whole cohort of workers on one agent, one per task |
| `⟢ route:` | `<task>` | Let the **host** pick the best-matching agent by capability (see below) — no agent named |
| `⟢ seal:` | `<N>` | Declare the expected cohort size, turning a best-effort join into a deterministic barrier at `N` |
| `⟢ merge:` | `<worker>` | Merge a finished worker's worktree back into the lead's |
| `⟢ handoff:` | `<agent> — <task>` | Hand the conversation to another agent (no result-back — a transfer, not a loan) |

Exactly one trailer acts per turn: the hub checks them in priority order
`done → delegate → fanout → route → seal → merge → handoff` and the first match
wins. Every outcome is echoed as a session status (`routé vers …`,
`cohorte scellée à N`, `merge traité pour …`, or `… refusé: <reason>`), so the
transcript records what the coordination layer did.

**Capability routing (`⟢ route:`) stays deterministic.** The host never asks an
LLM which agent should handle a task — that would break the invariant that only
agents judge. Instead each agent *declares* its own capabilities in an optional
`TAGS` file in its home (whitespace/comma-separated tokens, e.g. `network lua
roblox`). On `⟢ route:`, the host tokenizes the task text and picks the agent
whose tags overlap it most; ties break to the lexicographically smallest name,
and a task that matches no agent's tags is **refused** rather than sent to a
default. The only judgment is the agent's own tags plus the lead's phrasing of
the task — the host merely scores.

---

## Durable agents

A **durable agent** is a persistent companion that outlives any single session.
Where a session is disposable (its worktree is removed on close), an agent's home
is a long-lived directory holding its identity and provisioning files, so the same
persona can be dropped into a fresh worktree again and again.

An agent home lives at **`<stateDir>/agents/<name>/`**, where `<stateDir>` is
`$DCTL_STATE_DIR` if set, else `~/.config/dctl` (the directory holding
`state.json`). Each home seeds three source files:

| File in the home | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| `SOUL.md` | the agent's persona (a default companion persona if none is given) |
| `mcp.json` | an optional stdio MCP server declaration |
| `settings.json` | zero-prompt Claude settings (auto-enable project MCP servers, `acceptEdits`, an allow-list) |

Create and list agents from the operator binary or through a gateway (the Discord
gateway binds the same verbs as `/agent create` / `/agent list`):

```text
herrscher agent create --name <name> [--soul '<persona text>'] [--mcp 'neublox serve --project {{WORKTREE}}']
herrscher agent list
```

`soul:` seeds the persona; `mcp:` is a stdio MCP server command line whose first
token is both the server name and its command. The literal `{{WORKTREE}}` is
substituted with the session's worktree path at provision time.

**Provisioning into a session.** `session create … --agent NAME` (or `agent:NAME`
on Discord) materializes the agent into the new session's worktree as the files
Claude Code auto-reads from its working directory:

```text
<home>/SOUL.md       → <worktree>/.claude/CLAUDE.md
<home>/mcp.json      → <worktree>/.mcp.json
<home>/settings.json → <worktree>/.claude/settings.json
```

Because the materialized files live inside the disposable worktree, an agent
companion always needs an **isolated git worktree**: `--agent` is rejected with
`shared:true` or a non-git project.

### The vault (where memory lives)

Durable memory is an **Obsidian vault** the memory plugin **auto-provisions** — no
manual setup and no required env var. On first use it creates the vault directory
and a minimal `.obsidian/` app config, so the folder opens directly as an Obsidian
vault; existing config is never overwritten. By default it lives at
**`~/.herrscher/memory`** — outside any session worktree, so it survives worktree
teardown — and the optional **`OBSIDIAN_VAULT`** env var overrides the location.
Memory stays optional: if no memory plugin is compiled in, the bridge just runs
transcript-only.

### Memory scope (shared vs private)

A session carries a **project** and (optionally) an **agent**, and the supervisor
threads both to the bridge as `--project` / `--agent`. The orchestrator turns them
into a memory scope (P1): the **project** is the shared root — durable memory every
agent of that game recalls (decisions, conventions, the studio tree) — and the
**agent** is the private root for that companion's learned skills. Each turn the
orchestrator prepends the shared project memory and this agent's private skills
before the rolling session transcript.

Both scope roots (`projects/<project>/`, `agents/<agent>/`) are created in the
vault at session start, so recall is well-defined from the first turn even before
anything has been written. Both are optional and backward-compatible: with no
project the bridge omits the flags and the orchestrator falls back to
transcript-only continuity. The policy
itself lives in [herrscher-contracts](https://github.com/Herrscherd/herrscher-contracts)
(`MemoryScope`) and is applied by
[herrscher-orchestrator](https://github.com/Herrscherd/herrscher-orchestrator).

### Learning (the write side)

The scope above is also the **write** axis. By default an agent only *recalls*
durable memory; turning on **learning** lets it *grow* that memory by
consolidating a session's work into new scoped nodes. Learning is **opt-in and
off by default** — with no extractor configured the orchestrator stays the plain
`Curator` and a deployment is byte-for-byte unchanged.

Enable it per session at `session create` (the supervisor forwards each as a
bridge flag, which the bridge threads into the orchestrator config):

| `session create` param | bridge flag | orchestrator config key | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `extractor` | `--extractor NAME` | `memory.extractor` | names a registered curation extractor — the switch that turns learning on |
| `journal` | `--journal PATH` | `memory.journal` | the call journal `Consolidate` reads (worktree-relative ok) |
| `consolidate_every` | `--consolidate-every N` | `memory.consolidate-every` | run `Consolidate` every N turns (`0` = manual only) |

With an extractor named, the orchestrator becomes a `Learner`: every
`consolidate-every` turns it runs the extractor over the journal and persists
each candidate under the right scope — **facts** under the shared project root
(`projects/<project>`, via `RecordShared`) and **skills** under the private agent
root (`agents/<agent>`, via `RecordPrivate`).

**No default extractor ships.** The heuristics that decide *what is worth
remembering* are the closed part of the moat; this repo wires only the seam, so
an empty or unknown `extractor` name fails open to the plain `Curator` (no
learning) rather than erroring. A concrete extractor is plugged in by blank
import.

Policy:

- **Multi-writer.** Shared project memory is written by *every* agent of the
  game — an agent fleet co-curates one project graph.
- **Collision → shared wins.** If the same key is both shared and private,
  scoped recall surfaces the shared copy and drops the private duplicate
  (`mergeSubgraphs`, in herrscher-contracts).
- **Idempotent.** `Consolidate` re-runs every N turns over the same journal, but
  a per-session `seen` set skips already-persisted keys — so re-running adds no
  duplicate facts/skills, and is a no-op when nothing new is extracted.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+
- A Discord bot token (the default Gateway is Discord)

```bash
# a fresh clone builds on its own — go.mod points at published, tagged
# modules from github.com/Herrscherd, so the proxy resolves the plugins.
git clone https://github.com/Herrscherd/herrscher.git
```

(For cross-repo development against local checkouts, see [Layout &
wiring](#layout--wiring) — use a `go.work` workspace, not `replace` directives.)

### Build the single binary

```bash
cd herrscher
go build -o herrscher .          # the only binary; plugins are compiled in
```

### Install system-wide (Arch / pacman)

The repo ships a `PKGBUILD`, so on Arch-based systems you can build and install
under pacman management:

```bash
makepkg -si                      # builds and installs /usr/bin/herrscherd
```

The packaged binary is named `herrscherd`.

### Run it directly (foreground)

```bash
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=...      # required
export DCTL_OWNER_ID=...          # optional: seeds the allowlist with you

./herrscher serve --health-addr :8787
```

`GET /health` returns JSON liveness plus a `metrics` object — runtime counters
(turns started/completed/abandoned, bridge restarts, remote resolve
attempts/failures) and remote-call latency (count, p50/p95). The 60s status embed
carries the turn and restart counts too.

Then in Discord: `/set home #your-category`, `/session create name:hello`, and
start talking in the session channel.

### Install as a boot-started service (recommended)

`herrscher service install` writes a native service for your OS and a `0600`
secrets template — it never bakes the token into the unit file.

```bash
./herrscher service install \
  --cmd "claude --model claude-opus-4-8 --effort low" \
  --health-addr :8787
```

| OS | What it creates |
|----|-----------------|
| **Linux** | systemd **user** unit `~/.config/systemd/user/dctl.service` (`Restart=always`), enables it, runs `loginctl enable-linger` so it survives logout |
| **macOS** | launchd LaunchAgent `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.vskstudio.dctl.plist` (`RunAtLoad`, `KeepAlive`) |
| **Windows** | a Task Scheduler task `dctl` (on-logon trigger) wrapping `herrscher serve` |

It also scaffolds (never clobbering existing files):

- `~/.config/dctl/dctl.env` — the secrets file the service sources
  (`DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=`, `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=`, `DCTL_OWNER_ID=`)
- `~/.config/dctl/config.json` — the config template (see [Configuration](#configuration))

Then fill the token and (re)start:

```bash
$EDITOR ~/.config/dctl/dctl.env      # set DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
./herrscher service restart
./herrscher service status
```

### Update an installed service

```bash
cd herrscher
./herrscher service update           # git pull --ff-only, rebuild the installed binary, restart
./herrscher service update --no-pull # rebuild from local source only
```

`service update` rebuilds the **installed** binary (not the one you invoked) and
schedules the restart out-of-band (on Linux via `systemd-run`), so it survives the
daemon being killed mid-restart.

### Uninstall

```bash
./herrscher service uninstall        # disable + remove the unit (leaves your config/secrets)
```

## CLI reference

`herrscher <command>`. Output is deliberately minimal (ids and one-line
messages) so an agent reading stdout spends few tokens. The host exposes no raw
channel verbs of its own — all chat I/O goes through the active gateway plugin's
`Gateway` port; the low-level Discord poking lives in `dctl`, consumed by the
gateway plugin alone.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `serve [--config PATH] [--state FILE] [--health-addr ADDR] [--status-channel ID] [--env-file PATH] [--instance SLUG] [--cmd '…']` | The always-on Gateway daemon: per-session bridge supervision, health endpoint. |
| `bridge -c CHANNEL --hub-socket SOCK [--cmd '…'] [--backend stream\|oneshot] [--model M] [--session N] [--project P] [--agent A] …` | One pure-runner backend over the daemon's control socket. Normally spawned by `serve`. `--project`/`--agent` set the [memory scope](#memory-scope-shared-vs-private) (the supervisor threads them from the session's own project/agent). |
| `session <create\|close\|list\|who> [--name N] [--project P] [--clone R] [--cmd '…'] [--backend stream\|oneshot] [--shared] [--agent NAME] [--force]` | Manage sessions: create a bridged channel + worktree + backend (optionally provisioned from a durable [agent](#durable-agents)), close one, or list/inspect active ones. |
| `agent <create\|list> [--name N] [--soul '…'] [--mcp '…']` | Manage durable companion [agents](#durable-agents): a home with persona + MCP + zero-prompt settings, materialized into a session worktree via `session create --agent`. |
| `service <install\|uninstall\|status\|restart\|update> [--cmd '…'] [--health-addr ADDR] [--env-file PATH] [--source DIR] [--no-pull]` | Manage the daemon as a native OS service (see [Installation](#installation)). |

The host self-management verbs — `init`, `plugin`, `update`, `install` — compose
and maintain the compiled-in plugin set; see [Managing
plugins](#managing-plugins-the-init--plugin--update--install-verbs).

**Environment:** the **active gateway plugin declares its own required vars** (the
Discord gateway needs `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`); the host resolves them generically.
Common ones: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` (default channel),
`DCTL_OWNER_ID` (seed allowlist), `DCTL_STATE_DIR` (state dir, default
`~/.config/dctl`), `DCTL_INSTANCE_ID` (namespace slug for shared resources),
`OBSIDIAN_VAULT` (memory vault path, optional — auto-provisioned at
`~/.herrscher/memory` if unset). All
of these can be supplied via the root `.env` (see [Configuration](#configuration)).
Operator logging: `HERRSCHER_LOG` sets the structured (`log/slog`) level on stderr
— `debug|info|warn|error`, default `info`; the bridge's `-v` flag forces `debug`.
Remote transport (opt-in, see [Roadmap](#roadmap)): `HERRSCHER_REMOTE` —
comma-separated categories to run out-of-process (`memory`, `orchestrator`,
`backend`; unset ⇒ all in-process) — and `HERRSCHER_NATS` — the NATS URL (default
`nats://127.0.0.1:4222`). For multi-machine, set the plugin-host bind with
`HERRSCHER_BIND` (default `127.0.0.1:0`) and turn on mTLS with `HERRSCHER_TLS_CA`,
`HERRSCHER_TLS_CERT`, `HERRSCHER_TLS_KEY` (all three or none — a partial set fails
closed). With TLS unset the transport stays plaintext loopback, exactly as a
single-host deployment.

### `memory` — locate, forget, record memory nodes

`herrscher memory <locate|forget|record> --key K [...]` drives the compiled-in
memory plugin (e.g. `obsidian`) directly through the operator registry, one node
at a time. Consommé par Neublox via exec (voir issue #44). `--json` prints the raw
`contracts.Location` payload instead of a single URI. Uses `OBSIDIAN_VAULT` like
the rest of the memory surface (see [Environment](#cli-reference) above).

```bash
herrscher memory record --key demo/fact --kind decision --title "Demo"
herrscher memory locate --key demo/fact --json
herrscher memory forget --key demo/fact
```

---

## Managing plugins (the `init` / `plugin` / `update` / `install` verbs)

The same binary manages its own plugin composition (the `manage/` package). These
verbs do **not** run the runtime; they edit `plugins.go` (the blank-import list
between the `herrscher:plugins` / `herrscher:end` markers) and rebuild.

### `init` — compose the stack from a catalog

`herrscher init` builds a fresh plugin stack from a built-in **catalog** of
published modules, picking **one kind per category** (gateway / backend / memory /
orchestrator). With no flags it writes the batteries-included **default stack**:
`discord` + `claude` + `obsidian` + `orchestrator` (`basic`). It rewrites
`plugins.go` to exactly that set, seeds a `.env` from `.env.example` (never
clobbering an existing one), then `go get`s each module, `go mod tidy`s and
rebuilds. If the build fails it restores the original `plugins.go`.

**Interactive wizard.** Run on a terminal with no stack flags, `herrscher init`
prompts for each category (pick a kind or `none`) then reads the active gateway's
secrets — the Discord bot token is read with **echo disabled**, so it never
appears on screen — and upserts them into `.env` (existing keys preserved). Pass
`--yes`, any stack flag, or run non-interactively (a service/CI pipe) to skip the
wizard and take the flags/defaults silently.

When `init` finds **no source checkout** (the common case for a pacman-installed
binary, whose plugins are already compiled in) it runs in **config-only** mode:
it skips the plugin menu and the rebuild, collecting only the gateway secrets and
writing them to `$HERRSCHER_ENV_FILE` (else `./.env`), then points you at
`herrscherd serve`.

```bash
herrscher init                                     # interactive wizard on a tty, else default stack
herrscher init --yes                               # the default stack, no prompts, then build
herrscher init --list                              # print the module catalog and exit
herrscher init --memory none --orchestrator none   # drop a category ("none"), no wizard
herrscher init --backend claude --with github.com/acme/extra-plugin   # pin an extra module
herrscher init --no-build                           # rewrite plugins.go + seed .env only
```

Flags: `--gateway/--backend/--memory/--orchestrator K` choose the kind for a
category (or `none` to drop it), `--with MODULE` pins an extra module path
verbatim (repeatable), `--list` prints the catalog, `--no-build` stops after
writing `plugins.go`, `--yes` skips the wizard.

### `plugin` / `update` / `install`

```bash
herrscher plugin list                              # compiled-in plugins
herrscher plugin add github.com/acme/slack-gateway # blank-import, go get, tidy, build
herrscher plugin remove github.com/acme/slack-gateway
herrscher update                                   # go get -u every plugin, tidy, rebuild
herrscher install -- --health-addr :8787           # build the host, then delegate to `service install`
```

`herrscher update` refreshes the **plugin** modules (the counterpart to
`herrscher service update`, which pulls the host's own source). `herrscher
install` builds the binary then forwards everything after `--` to `herrscher
service install` — it never reimplements the systemd/launchd glue.

---

## Layout & wiring

The binary is one Go module (`core/`, `manage/`, and the root `main` package).
The contracts module and the edge plugins are separate modules. There are **no
`replace` directives**: the committed `go.mod` references **published, tagged
modules** from `github.com/Herrscherd`, so a fresh clone builds straight from the
module proxy with nothing checked out beside it.

For local multi-repo development you stitch the siblings together with a **`go.work`
workspace** (untracked) instead of replaces:

```
herrscher-dev/
├── go.work                    ← `go work use ./herrscher ./herrscher-contracts …` (local only)
├── herrscher/                 ← the only main(); core + manage + plugins.go (this repo)
│   ├── core/                  ← the agnostic domain
│   └── manage/                ← the plugin-composition CLI
├── herrscher-contracts/       ← the ports (separate module)
├── herrscher-discord-gateway/ ← Gateway plugin (separate module)
├── herrscher-claude-backend/  ← Backend plugin (separate module)
├── herrscher-obsidian-memory/ ← Memory plugin (separate module)
├── herrscher-orchestrator/    ← Orchestrator plugin (separate module)
└── dctl/                      ← the gateway plugin's Discord REST client
```

The workspace redirects the published module paths to the local checkouts while
you hack across repos; remove it (or `GOWORK=off`) to build against the tagged
releases exactly as a fresh clone would.

---

## Configuration

Precedence, highest first: **CLI flag → environment → `config.json` → built-in
default**. The service sources secrets from a separate `0600` env file so they
never live in the unit.

### The root `.env`

At startup the host auto-loads a project-root **`.env`** so every command — and
every plugin's config resolution — sees its vars without an explicit
`--env-file`. A real environment variable always wins over the file. The path is
overridable with **`$HERRSCHER_ENV_FILE`**; it is resolved to an absolute path and
re-exported, so each `bridge` subprocess (which runs with its working directory
set to a per-session worktree) loads the *same* file rather than a stray `.env`
sitting in that tree. The implicit `./.env` is best-effort (a missing file is not
an error), while an explicit `$HERRSCHER_ENV_FILE` is authoritative — a load
failure there is fatal. A `.env.example` ships as a fill-in skeleton; `herrscher
init` seeds `.env` from it. Which keys are required depends on the active gateway
plugin (the Discord gateway needs `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`).

`~/.config/dctl/config.json`:

```json
{
  "cmd": "claude --model claude-opus-4-8 --effort low",
  "healthAddr": ":8787",
  "statusChannel": "",
  "instance": "",
  "owner": "",
  "home": { "id": "category_or_forum_id", "type": "category" },
  "workspace": "/path/to/projects",
  "source": "/path/to/herrscher/checkout"
}
```

- `cmd` — the base bridged command for new sessions (a per-session `cmd:` overrides it).
- `home` — where `/session create` puts channels (a category or a forum), set via `/set home`.
- `workspace` — root scanned for `project:` (the sub-dir a session's backend works on).
- `source` — checkout `/service update` rebuilds from.

---

## Roadmap

- **More catalog kinds** — additional gateway/backend/memory/orchestrator modules
  in the `herrscher init` catalog beyond the current defaults.
- **Distributed transport** — shipped: any of **memory**, **orchestrator**, and
  the streaming **backend** can run as a separate process over NATS (discovery) +
  gRPC (port calls), opt-in per category via `HERRSCHER_REMOTE`; in-process stays
  the default. The wire lives in the separate `herrscher-transport` module, and
  remote mode needs a NATS server at `$HERRSCHER_NATS`. Remote resolves are bounded
  by a per-attempt timeout and retried on backoff within a total deadline
  (in-process stays immediate). The backend streams its turn events; a lost stream
  abandons the in-flight turn cleanly and the next input proceeds. **Multi-machine**
  is a config flip: set `HERRSCHER_BIND` off loopback and supply an mTLS CA/cert/key
  via `HERRSCHER_TLS_*` (fail-closed on a partial set) — no contract change.

---

## A note on history

The platform grew out of a Go monolith (`dctl`) that bridged Discord to a local
Claude. Herrscher is that monolith decomposed along its natural seams — channel,
model, domain — so each can evolve independently. The contract shapes were chosen
deliberately to make the eventual transport change (in-process → NATS/gRPC) a
detail, not a rewrite.
